# random-python-scripts

A collection of random short scripts I wrote in python, mostly for fun.

### Highlights:
**room_movement.py**<p>
Movement mechanics for a text based adventure game I created. There were many possible ways to do this, but I found that assigning fluid values to a dictionary and iterating through to determine your current bearings has worked best. Includes an area at the end for testing the program. 

**nhl_standings_project (folder)**<p>
As a hockey fan, I've always been surprised at the lack of published data on team trends over the course of a season. For example, the Buffalo Sabres started their 2019-2020 season going 9-2-2, one of the top teams in the league. By the end of the season, however, they had dropped to 30-31-8. Nobody remembers their phenominal first month because of their final record. This project scraped standings from the National Hockey League to show trends in teams over the course of a season. I will eventually publish data from several seasons, showing which teams tend to start strong, which teams start slow but pick up momentum as the season progresses, etc.

**fwc_tour_dates_scrape**<p>
Used to see if any bands that are signed under my favorite record label *Fat Wreck Chords* are touring nearby. Gives you the ability to input your state and get a list of every band that has a date scheduled through there, without having to click on each individual band and check manually. 


**sports_betting_ml_project (IN PROGRESS)**<p>
Planning to create an algorithm that looks at current odds and selects those that are most likely to hit.
